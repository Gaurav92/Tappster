Tappster
========
This was my first app developed long. This was when I started learning Android development. I had recently learnt Button Listener, used it to made a small android app(2 player game).


It uses two button listener. When a player press a button the players scores increases. It is a game to prove how fast can you tap.
I hope you enjoy it.
	
	
Added extra feature of time and player name.
