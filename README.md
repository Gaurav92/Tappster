Tappster
========

This is my first app developed long. This was when I started learning Android developement. I had recently learnt Button Listener. Using it I made a small app(2 player game).
	It uses two button listener. When a player press a button the players scores increases. It is a game to prove how fast can you tap. I hope you enjoy it. 
	Added extra feature of time and player name.
	Feel free to contribute. :)
